Output:

This morning Larry woke up feeling refreshed. 'It is going to be a great day!' Outside, a bunch of space rangers were protesting to keep victoria's not so secret secret 
in stores. They began to dance to the rhythm of the night, which made all the locals very bewildered. Concerned, Larry texted Pinky, who flew Larry to
kinmoku and dropped Larry in a puddle of frozen hopes and dreams. Larry woke up in the year 3000, in a world where firebenders ruled the world.
